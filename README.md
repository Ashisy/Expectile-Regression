# Expectile-Regression
 A R code for expectile regression
 
Here are two useful R functions that can be used to generate expectile data and perform expectile regression using the LAWS method.
As scientific computing tools, they are not encapsulated very well. So you can easily modify the source code, such as such as modifying the density function of the error term or adding the weight you want to the laws method.
